# Ethnicity_Mapping


India is a land of diverse culture. People come from various ethnic backgrounds and speak different mother tongue.

This is a project as a part of my Summer Internship of the Summer of 2018.
The Problem Statement was to give a name as an INPUT and the OUTPUT will be its ethnicity as "Bengali" , "Telegu" etc.

The DataSet used have been provided by Data Sutram.
